## Server
##

    # dumps, and as such, should be resolvable and reachable from
    # the connectors.

    # Specify the port of the server. It is the main entrypoint to the web
    # interface to handle web traffic, but is also used when generating links
    # for connectors to download the uploaded database dumps.

    # If behind a web server, traffic should be routed to this port.

## Email settings

##
## Folder mounting
##

    #
    # Specify an absolute path that the application will "mount". This means that users will
    # be able to navigate the folders and see the files of the mounted location, but will not
    # be able to "escape" it, e.g. move to its parent directory.
    #
    # Used to allow users to select dumpfiles already on the file system without having to upload
    # them again.
    #
