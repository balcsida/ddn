# Distributed Database Network Agent

Distributed Database Network Agent, or ddna for short, is a minimal JSON REST API server to run on a virtual or physical machine which has one or more database servers installed. The purpose of the DDN Agent is to act as a unified interface between the outside world and the database server to handle request to create a database / schema along with a connecting user, as well as to list databases / schemas, drop them, and finally, to create a database from a previously provided dump.
